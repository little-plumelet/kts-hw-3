            "description": "Enticing and lively red color; beautifully aromatic with black cherry and ripe plum. On the palate a purity of blackcurrant, cedar and mint flavors blend together seamlessly. Soft and supple, this wine has a medium-bodied mouth-feel with plush tannins that integrate with the generous finish.Our favorite pairings for this wine include chicken parmesan, cedar-planked salmon over wild rice, and mushroom pizza.",
